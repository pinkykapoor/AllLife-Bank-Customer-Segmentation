# AllLife Bank Customer Segmentation

## Context

AllLife Bank wants to focus on its credit card customer base in the next financial year. They have been advised by their marketing research team, that the penetration in the market can be improved. Based on this input, the Marketing team proposes to run personalized campaigns to target new customers as well as upsell to existing customers. Another insight from the market research was that the customers perceive the support services of the back poorly. Based on this, the Operations team wants to upgrade the service delivery model, to ensure that customer queries are resolved faster. Head of Marketing and Head of Delivery both decide to reach out to the Data Science team for help.

 

## Objective

To identify different segments in the existing customer, based on their spending patterns as well as past interaction with the bank, using clustering algorithms, and provide recommendations to the bank on how to better market to and service these customers.

 

## Data Description

The data provided is of various customers of a bank and their financial attributes like credit limit, the total number of credit cards the customer has, and different channels through which customers have contacted the bank for any queries (including visiting the bank, online and through a call center).
